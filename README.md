The Model-View-Controller (“MVC”) design pattern is useful, but it doesn’t scale well. As projects grow in size and complexity, this limitation becomes more apparent. In this Coordinator tutorial, you’ll try a different approach: Coordinators.

If you’re unfamiliar with the term, don’t worry! It’s a simple architecture that doesn’t require any third party frameworks, and it’s easy to adopt in your existing MVC projects.

By the end of this Coordinator tutorial, you’ll be able to decide which approach works best for you when building your apps.
